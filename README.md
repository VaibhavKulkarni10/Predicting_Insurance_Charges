# Insurance Charges Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
In today's fast-paced world, regardless of age, people are increasingly experiencing health issues due to factors like busy schedules, lack of exercise, and unhealthy habits such as smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, and lack of sleep. These factors contribute to chronic diseases, which are a growing concern in modern society. Additionally, rising living expenses and sedentary behavior have exacerbated health problems, placing significant strain on individuals' well-being and healthcare systems worldwide.

As medical expenses continue to rise, individuals face an increasing financial burden. Medical insurance plays a crucial role in mitigating these risks by covering expenses and providing access to the best possible healthcare services. However, with numerous insurance companies offering various policies, customers often find it challenging to choose the best insurance coverage at the right price.

To address this challenge, we aim to build a sustainable solution by developing a pricing model that accurately predicts insurance charges. This model will benefit both customers and insurance companies by providing insights into how different factors influence insurance costs, allowing for better decision-making and strategic growth.

## Dataset
We use a publicly available dataset containing the following variables:

* Age
* Sex
* Body Mass Index (BMI)
* Number of children
* Smoking status
* Region
* Charges

Through in-depth analysis of these variables, we will create a multiple linear regression model to predict insurance charges accurately. The model will provide valuable insights for customers and insurance companies, helping them understand how each factor influences charges and enabling companies to develop strategies for growth.

## Methodology
To achieve our objective, we have divided our methodology into the following steps:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  * Data Understanding: Identify the type of variables and determine if any need transformation (e.g., converting categorical variables).
  * Data Summary: Summarize the data to gain deeper insights.
  * Visualization: Plot various visualizations to explore relationships between regressors and the response variable, checking their significance and correlation.

* Multiple Regression Estimation
  * Model Building: Using the final set of regressors from the EDA, build a Multiple Regression Model in R to generate predictions.

* Model Assessment
  * Performance Evaluation: Assess the model's performance by examining R-Squared values and the significance of each regressor.
  * Accuracy Determination: Evaluate the model's accuracy and its effectiveness in making predictions.

* Model Adequacy & Diagnostic Check
  * Adequacy Tests: Perform tests to check for normal distribution, constant variance, outliers, and influential data points.
  * Multicollinearity Analysis: Analyze multicollinearity and its impact on the model's results.
  * Residual Analysis: Plot residuals and component-residual plots to assess model adequacy.

* Transformation
  * Issue Resolution: If issues like heteroscedasticity or multicollinearity are detected, perform Box-Cox transformation to address them.
  * Lambda Calculation: Calculate the value of lambda and apply square or log transformations as needed.
  * Adequacy Recheck: Perform diagnostic checks to ensure issues have been resolved.

* Variable Selection
  * Feasibility Check: Determine if all regressors are feasible for the model.
  * Regressor Selection: Use all possible regressor methods (e.g., Cp, Adjusted R2) and PRESS to identify the best fit model. If not feasible, apply stepwise techniques.

* Model Validation
  * Cross-Validation: Validate the model using techniques like cross-validation to predict outcomes on new or unseen data.
