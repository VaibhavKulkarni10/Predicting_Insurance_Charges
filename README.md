# Insurance Charges Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression

## Project Overview
In today's fast-paced world, regardless of age, people are increasingly experiencing health issues due to factors like busy schedules, lack of exercise, and unhealthy habits such as smoking, alcohol consumption, stress, and lack of sleep. These factors contribute to chronic diseases, which are a growing concern in modern society. Additionally, rising living expenses and sedentary behavior have exacerbated health problems, placing significant strain on individuals' well-being and healthcare systems worldwide.

As medical expenses continue to rise, individuals face an increasing financial burden. Medical insurance plays a crucial role in mitigating these risks by covering expenses and providing access to the best possible healthcare services. However, with numerous insurance companies offering various policies, customers often find it challenging to choose the best insurance coverage at the right price.

To address this challenge, we aim to build a sustainable solution by developing a pricing model that accurately predicts insurance charges. This model will benefit both customers and insurance companies by providing insights into how different factors influence insurance costs, allowing for better decision-making and strategic growth.
